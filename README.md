Here are my scripts that I used to undertake a 'blind survey' of ultra-deep data obtained from the state of the art Atacama Millimeter/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), used to study the CR7 dataset (Matthee et al. 2017) https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06569

The blind survey code is calibrated to replicate manually studying the data cube by eye, and automates the process of searching for candidate galaxies within complex ALMA datasets (turning a job which took ~ weeks for humans to complete into ~ minutes). My blind survey unveils strong candidates for previosly undetected [CII] emitting galaxies residing in the early universe within the 'epoch of reionization' at (z ~ 6.6, 12.9 billion years ago). My findings hold wider implications into the nature of the epoch of reionization, suggesting that overdense regions (with more galaxies in the region than the average field of space) likely reionize the surrounding neutral intergalactic hydrogen at a faster rate. 

I have attached the latest draft of the paper (Day et al. in prep) which will be replaced with the latest version of the paper as it becomes available.
